// 2 approaches one using Priority Queue & other using Set
/* APPROACH 1 USING PRIORITY QUEUE

EXPLANATION

1. To decrease the deviation either increase the minn or decrease the maxx.
2. Now, Make every number as maximum as possible to eliminate one operation(increase the minn)
3. since every element is as maximum as possible , you can not increase any number further
4. Now we are left with just one operation decrease the maxx
5. So perform this operation as many times as u can and keep track of the min_deviation 
Time Complexity: O(nlog(m)log(n))
Space Complexity: O(n)

If the maximum element is m, the number of candidates in its range is at most log(m), which happens when it is a power of 2. 
There are n elements, for a maximum of nlog(m) candidates.
At each step, a new element is inserted into the priority queue with a time complexity of O(log(n)).*/

/*  APPROACH 2 USING SET

EXPLANATION

Even numbers can be divided multiple times until it converts to an odd number.
Odd numbers can be doubled only once as it converts to an even number.
Therefore, even numbers can never be increased.
Follow the steps below to solve the problem: 
 

1. Traverse the vector and double all the odd vector elements. This nullifies the requirement for the 2nd operation.
2. Now, decrease the largest vector element while it’s even.
3. To store the vector elements in sorted manner, insert all vector elements into a Set.
4. Greedily reduce the maximum element present in the Set
5. If the maximum element present in the Set is odd, break the loop.
6. Print the minimum deviation obtained.
Time Complexity : O(N * log(N))
Space Complexity : O(N)

while loop O(n)
1.) begin():-Returns an iterator to the first element in the set. Tc=O(log(n))
2.) rbegin():-Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the last element in the container. Tc=O(log(n))

Hence,
Worst caseTime Complexity= O(n * log(n));           */
